This tutorial and demo project will show you how to add, set up, configure, and verify Swagger documentation to your developer WebApi project. The final results are in this code repo. 

Swashbuckle and Swagger are two popular tools used for generating developer documentation for web APIs. Swashbuckle is a package that can be added to an ASP.NET Core web API project to integrate the Swagger UI. It has three main components: Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger, which is a Swagger object model and middleware to expose SwaggerDocument objects as JSON endpoints; Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen, which is a Swagger generator that builds SwaggerDocument objects directly from your routes, controllers, and models; and Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI, which is an embedded version of the Swagger UI tool. It interprets Swagger JSON to build a rich, customizable experience for describing the web API functionality. Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code. Its main goals are to minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services. ¹³⁴

Although tutorials, videos, and documentation were referenced, this project is creatively my own code and style to demo my technical expertise and contribute to the collective tech knowledge on GitHub. I have listed some of the sources where I drew some code examples and knowledge.
