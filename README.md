## Web Api CRUD
## Web Api Patch
## Error/Handling Display
## Swagger Documentation

This tutorial and demo project will show you how to add, set up, configure, and verify Swagger documentation to your developer WebApi project. The final results are in this code repo. 

Swashbuckle and Swagger are two popular tools used for generating developer documentation for web APIs. Swashbuckle is a package that can be added to an ASP.NET Core web API project to integrate the Swagger UI. It has three main components: Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger, which is a Swagger object model and middleware to expose SwaggerDocument objects as JSON endpoints; Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen, which is a Swagger generator that builds SwaggerDocument objects directly from your routes, controllers, and models; and Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI, which is an embedded version of the Swagger UI tool. It interprets Swagger JSON to build a rich, customizable experience for describing the web API functionality. Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code. Its main goals are to minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services. ¹³⁴

## Client Tester
## Unit Testing

This tutorial and demo project will show how to set up, configure, and code simple unit tests for a WebApi project.

In this video, we will discuss how to write simple unit tests for a web API with CRUD controller operations. We will be using xUnit and FakeItEasy packages to write the tests. We will cover the basics of unit testing, including how to set up the test project, how to write tests for each CRUD operation, and how to use xUnit and FakeItEasy to create mocks and stubs. We will also discuss best practices for writing unit tests, such as keeping tests independent and ensuring that they are easy to read and maintain.
